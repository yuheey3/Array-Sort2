# Array-Sort2

## **** PROBLEM ****

// Write a program that sorts a list of comma separated products.

// Each input row looks like "TITLE,POPULARITY,PRICE". Meaning "Selfie Stick,98,29" says we sold 98 "Selfie Stick"s at 29 dollars each. All numbers are integers. The input will be provided in a hardcoded array so no file I/O is needed.

// The list should be sorted by:

// By most popular first.
// If products are equally popular, sort by cheapest price (lower is better).
// You don't need to write your own sorting algorithm. It's recommended to use a built-in sorting library.

## **** SOLUTION ****

The orderby clause is used.

It sorts string element which is after the first comma and then sort by the element which is the after the second comma.
